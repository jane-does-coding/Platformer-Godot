# Maze Platformer! (Also my first godot game!!)

This is the first time I've ever made a game in Godot, and I loved it and the next one wil lbe fully my own! I watched a youtube tutorial on it, and after that fully changed a game to be a maze, where you have to collect all of the coins throughout the game map.
